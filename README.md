# Stuff

A repository where I will put a lot of things that have no exact location. Here will end up much of the things I am
learning or some small stuff that I would like to try out. Especially this is now a kind of initial repository, from
which I can and will hopefully take some things later, when I build up a decent structure.

In this readme I try to give a rough overview for me and all others who look at this repo.
So that I can find everything again :sweat_smile:

## CC_Projects

CC_Projects is my folder/module where I will put all the [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) projects I want to
accomplish. Mostly these will be
projects from the *Portfolio* or from larger *Carrer paths* or *Courses*.
